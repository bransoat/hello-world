Oh ay oh!
Oh ay oh!

Come along with me,
Let's head out to sea
What this world has for you and for me now.
Whichever way the wind blows,
We say, hey ho, let's go!

Oh ay oh!
This boat's rockin'!
Oh ay oh!
Ain't no stoppin' us now!
Cause we're livin' the suite life!

Oh ay oh!
This boat's rockin'!
Oh ay oh!
Rockin' the whole world round,
'Cause we're livin' the suite life now!

Hey Ho!
Oh ay oh!
Let's Go!
